      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I've been worrking as a web designer for 6 years at Ultradent Products, Inc. Where I design all things for the
        web. From Landing Pages to Homepage banner, emails and social media graphics. I've played around with motion
        graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated with honors from College of Southern Nevada, in Graphic Design. But found my passion working with
        the web.

      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        When I’m not working with the web, I spend my time with my kids or redesigning my wife’s website. I really enjoy
        photography, but rarely find the time to practice. I enjoy going to movies, usually anything by Marvel,
        Christopher Nolan, or JJ Abrams. I also am an avid runner, an unofficial evangelist for Apple, and I wear red
        chucks.
